# WheelOfFortune
This is a Java-made simulation of the popular game show "Wheel of Fortune." The game requires three players to play while the rules are similar to that of the show. Although the mechanics of this current release are are slightly inaccurate towards the rules of the show, it will still make for a fun experience with friends.

This program requires Java 8 or higher to run. After cloning all the files in the main branch, simply compile all of the Java files and run the WheelOfFortune class. A window displaying the game should open up. After clicking the start button on the title screen, input the names of your players and the game will start immediately after. Have fun! :)
