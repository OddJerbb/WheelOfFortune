# WheelOfFortune
This is a Java-made simulation of the popular game show "Wheel of Fortune." The game requires three players to play while the rules are similar to that of the show. The mechanics of this current release is not very accurate towards the rules of the show, but it will still make for a fun experience with friends. An updated version is currently being produced.

This program requires Java 8 or higher to run. After cloning all the files in the main branch, simply compile all of the Java files and run the WheelOfFortune class. A window displaying the game should open up. Have fun :)
