A FATE WORSE THAN DEATH
A GLIMPSE INTO THE FUTURE
A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN
BARKING UP THE WRONG TREE
BEST SEAT IN THE HOUSE
BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY
CAT GOT YOUR TONGUE?
CHIP OFF THE OLD BLOCK
CONTRARY TO POPULAR BELIEF
DIVIDE AND CONQUER
DON'T BE A PARTY POOPER
DRAWING A BLANK
ELVIS HAS LEFT THE BUILDING
ENJOY IT WHILE IT LASTS
EXCEEDING ALL EXPECTATIONS
FEAST YOUR EYES ON THIS
FOR YOUR INFORMATION
FUN FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY
GET INTO THE HOLIDAY SPIRIT
GOING BY THE BOOK
HANGING ON EVERY WORD
HAVE A VERY MERRY CHRISTMAS
HEART IN THE RIGHT PLACE
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND A WORD YOU'RE SAYING
IT WAS A DARK AND STORMY NIGHT
IT WAS A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU
KEEP THE BALL ROLLING
KEEP YOUR FINGERS CROSSED
KICKING UP YOUR HEELS
LET'S GRAB SOME LUNCH
LIVING IN PERFECT HARMONY
LOST IN THE TRANSLATION
MAKING A BIG SPLASH
MOVING TO GREENER PASTURES
NOTHING SUCCEEDS LIKE SUCCESS
