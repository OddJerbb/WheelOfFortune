A CHIP ON YOUR SHOULDER
A FATE WORSE THAN DEATH
A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN
A PIECE OF CAKE
ALL BARK AND NO BITE
BACK TO SQUARE ONE
BARKING UP THE WRONG TREE
BEATING AROUND THE BUSH
BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY
CHIP OFF THE OLD BLOCK
CONTRARY TO POPULAR BELIEF
CURIOSITY KILLED THE CAT
CUT TO THE CHASE
DON'T BE A PARTY POOPER
DON'T CRY OVER SPILLED MILK
DOWN FOR THE COUNT
DOWN TO THE WIRE
DRAWING A BLANK
ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM
ELVIS HAS LEFT THE BUILDING
ENJOY IT WHILE IT LASTS
EXCEEDING ALL EXPECTATIONS
FEAST YOUR EYES ON THIS
FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE
FISH OUT OF WATER
FUN FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY
GOING BY THE BOOK
HANGING ON EVERY WORD
HARD PILL TO SWALLOW
HEART IN THE RIGHT PLACE
HOW DO YOU LIKE THEM APPLES?
I SPY WITH MY LITTLE EYE
IT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE
KEEP YOUR FINGERS CROSSED
LIVING IN PERFECT HARMONY
LOST IN THE TRANSLATION
MAKING A BIG SPLASH
MONEY DOESN'T GROW ON TREES
MOVING TO GREENER PASTURES
NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK
NO IFS, ANDS, OR BUTS
NO QUESTIONS ASKED
RAIN ON YOUR PARADE
RAINING CATS AND DOGS
READ 'EM AND WEEP 'EM
SHOT IN THE DARK
STICK A FORK IN IT
THE EARLY BIRD GETS THE WORM
THROW IN THE TOWEL
TWO PEAS IN A POD
